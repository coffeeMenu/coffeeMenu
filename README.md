# coffeeMenu

## getting started

make sure you have `git`, `pnpm` and `yarn` installed on your system

1) clone this repo
2) install packages `pnpm i`
3) have all the packages([backend](https://github.com/coffeeMenu/coffeeMenu-backend), [dashboard](https://github.com/coffeeMenu/coffeeMenu-dashboard), [front](https://github.com/coffeeMenu/coffeeMenu-front) and [shared-logic](https://github.com/coffeeMenu/coffeeMenu-shared-logic)) under this(coffeeMenu) directory  
(clone and go through 'getting started' of each package)
4) finally run all the packages at once: `yarn dev`  
  
you are ready to go my friend ;)

### p.s

// also you can use whatever package manager you want(npm, yarn, pnpm) for <u>script running</u>. but we use `pnpm` for adding and removing packages. so please respect that.
