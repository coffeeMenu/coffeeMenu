# coffeeMenu

## getting started

make sure you have `git`, `pnpm` and `yarn` installed on your system

### install

#### automatic

clone this repo and just run ./install.sh to get every thing setup and run all the project: {link to run}

or alternatively walk through steps by hand:

##### by hand

- clone this repo
- install packages `pnpm i`
- have all the packages(backend, dashboard, front and shared-logic) under `coffeeMenu` directory (clone and go through `getting started` of each package)
- and run all the project: {link to run}

### run

- run all at once `yarn dev`

### p.s

// also you can use what ever package manager you like(npm, yarn, pnpm) for <u>script running</u>. but we use `pnpm` for adding and removing packages.

TODO: create a install.sh script to do all the necessary work to get up and running.
