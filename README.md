# coffeeMenu

## getting started

make sure you have `git`, `pnpm` and `yarn` installed on your system

- clone this repo
- install packages `pnpm i`
- have all the packages(backend, dashboard, front and shared-logic) under `coffeeMenu` directory (clone and go through `getting started` of each package)
- run all at once `yarn dev`

// also you can use what ever package manager you like(npm, yarn, pnpm) for <u>script running</u>. but we use `pnpm` for adding and removing packages.
